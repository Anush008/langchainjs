# ChatVertexAI

LangChain.js supports Google Vertex AI chat models as an integration.
It supports two different methods of authentication based on whether you're running
in a Node environment or a web environment.

## Setup

### Node

To call Vertex AI models in Node, you'll need to install the `@langchain/google-vertexai` package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-vertexai
```

You should make sure the Vertex AI API is
enabled for the relevant project and that you've authenticated to
Google Cloud using one of these methods:

- You are logged into an account (using `gcloud auth application-default login`)
  permitted to that project.
- You are running on a machine using a service account that is permitted
  to the project.
- You have downloaded the credentials for a service account that is permitted
  to the project and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
  variable to the path of this file.
**or**
- You set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key for the project.

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-vertexai
```

### Web

To call Vertex AI models in web environments (like Edge functions), you'll need to install
the `@langchain/google-vertexai-web` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/google-vertexai-web
```

Then, you'll need to add your service account credentials directly as a `GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:

```
GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_WEB_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"YOUR_PROJECT-12345",...}
```

Alternatively, you can set an API key as a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Lastly, you may also pass your credentials directly in code like this:

```typescript
import { ChatVertexAI } from "@langchain/google-vertexai-web";

const model = new ChatVertexAI({
  authOptions: {
    credentials: {"type":"service_account","project_id":"YOUR_PROJECT-12345",...},
  },
});
```

## Usage

The entire family of `gemini` models are available by specifying the `modelName` parameter.

For example:

import ChatVertexAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_googlevertexai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChatVertexAI}</CodeBlock>

### Streaming

`ChatVertexAI` also supports streaming in multiple chunks for faster responses:

import ChatVertexAIStreaming from "@examples/models/chat/integration_googlevertexai-streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChatVertexAIStreaming}</CodeBlock>
